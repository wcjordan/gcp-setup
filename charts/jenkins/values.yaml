## Jenkins containers' resource requests and limits
## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/
##
resources:
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  limits: {}
  #   cpu: 500m
  #   memory: 1Gi
  requests:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 512Mi

## Ingress paramaters
##
ingress:
  ## Set to true to enable ingress record generation
  ##
  enabled: true

  ## Set this to true in order to add the corresponding annotations for cert-manager
  ##
  certManager: false

  # Commented out so I can use extraHosts to set path to be a prefix match
  ## When the ingress is enabled, a host pointing to this will be created
  ##
  #hostname: jenkins.flipperkid.com
